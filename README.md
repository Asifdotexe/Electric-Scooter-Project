# Electric Scooter Listings Analysis

Welcome to the "Electric Scooter Listings Analysis" project repository! In this project, we analyze electric scooter listings data to gain insights into pricing trends, perform data cleaning and transformation, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project is organized into three Jupyter Notebook files:

## 1. [Electric Scooter Price Web Scraping from FlipKart](Electric%20Scooter%20Price%20Web%20Scraping%20from%20FlipKart.ipynb)

In this notebook, we utilize web scraping techniques to extract electric scooter price data from FlipKart using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, pandas, requests, and csv. The gathered data serves as the foundation for our analysis, providing information on various scooter models and their respective prices.

## 2. [Electric Scooter Data Cleaning and Transformation](Electric%20Scooter%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Transformation.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on the crucial steps of data cleaning and transformation. Leveraging the power of numpy and pandas, we address missing values, handle outliers, and structure the data for meaningful insights. The clean dataset becomes the basis for our subsequent exploratory data analysis.

## 3. [Electric Scooter Exploratory Data Analysis](Electric%20Scooter%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

In this notebook, we delve into the world of exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Through statistical analysis and visualizations, we uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the electric scooter data. This step enhances our understanding of the market and assists in making informed decisions.
